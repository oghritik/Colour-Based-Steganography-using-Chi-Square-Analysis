**Encoded Message** : J. Robert Oppenheimer led the scientific effort that created the first atomic bomb during World War II. After the discovery of nuclear fission, the United States launched the Manhattan Project to stay ahead of Nazi Germany. Oppenheimer directed the Los Alamos Laboratory, bringing together top physicists and guiding work on two designs: the uranium gun type and the plutonium implosion type. He supervised theory, engineering, and the Trinity Test in July 1945. Its success proved the weapon worked and reshaped global warfare. After the war, Oppenheimer warned about nuclear danger and supported international control.

## Example 3

**Encoded Message** : The social network tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg, a brilliant but socially awkward Harvard student who creates a small campus website that quickly evolves into Facebook, propelling him into unexpected fame while triggering conflicts that reshape his relationships and future. As Facebook grows, Zuckerberg's partnership with Eduardo Saverin strains under business tensions, shifting priorities, and the arrival of Sean Parker, whose influence accelerates expansion but deepens internal divides. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins accuse Zuckerberg of stealing their idea, launching a legal battle that forces him to confront questions of ethics, ownership, and ambition. The film unfolds through deposition hearings intercut with flashbacks, revealing a complex web of genius, betrayal, and the emotional cost of rapid innovation. Zuckerberg's success isolates him even as millions join the platform he built to connect people, creating a portrait of a young founder navigating power, responsibility, and loneliness in the digital era, ultimately suggesting that achievement without empathy can leave even the most influential creator longing for genuine connection.
